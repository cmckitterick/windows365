# Known issues: Windows 365 Link

The following items are known issues for Windows 365 Enterprise.

## Missing or renamed options in Cloud PC Display settings app for Windows 365 Link device <!--53427829-->

When users connect to a Cloud PC from a Windows 365 Link device, some options aren't available in the **System** > **Display** app. Instead, you can use **Open additional settings** to adjust arrangement and scale of up to two monitors attached.

## Locking the Cloud PC doesn't take the user back to the **Sign in** screen <!--56487937-->

This issue can happen if you lock the device by selecting **Start** > **Power** > **Lock** inside your connection. To remediate:

1. Perform one of the other sequences to [lock or disconnect your Windows 365 Link](sign-in.md)
2. Follow the steps to [configure session lock behavior](/azure/virtual-desktop/configure-session-lock-behavior?tabs=intune) for single sign-on connections such that the **Disconnect remote session on lock for Microsoft identity platform authentication** policy is set to **Enabled**.

## Keyboard layout changes after update<!--57722380-->

After updating to version 26100.4061, the previously selected keyboard layout might be automatically switched back to the default.

To correct this issue, users can manually select their preferred keyboard layout again. This one-time action makes sure that the keyboard setting is saved correctly going forward.
