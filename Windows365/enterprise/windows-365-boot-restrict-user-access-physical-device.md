# Allow or restrict user access to Windows 365 Boot physical device

Windows 365 Boot physical devices are intended to let users interact with their Cloud PCs without the ability to interact with the physical device. To meet this goal, you must set some configuration service provider (CSP) policies.

Windows 365 Boot doesn't automatically set these policies to fully restrict end users from accessing certain resources on the physical device. Admins should review the following CSPs and decide which ones to implement on the physical device to meet your organization's security requirements.

Using a configuration policy, you can also allow users to access the physical PC from the CTRL-ALT-DEL screen, Cloud PC error screens, or both.

## Allow user access to the physical device

Using the physical device access policy, you can allow users to access the physical PC. Users may want to access the physical PC when they're unable to:

- Sign in to their Cloud PC (during internet outages or Microsoft service outages).
- Sign in to a Captive Wi-Fi.  

Users can access the physical PC from the CTRL-ALT-DEL screen or error screens, configurable by the administrator. When a user selects **Return to physical PC sign in** button on either screen, they're taken to the sign-in screen on their physical device. To return to the Cloud PC sign-on page, users can lock or sign out of the physical PC.

For any group of users, you can choose whether users have access to the physical PC from the CTRL-ALT-DEL screen, error screens, both, or neither. **Neither** is the default. After the setting is changed, users can see the **Return to physical sign in** buttons.  

Admins configure this policy using the Guided Scenario for Boot in the **Assignments** tab, or manually. For more information, see [Configuration service providers - User/EnablePhysicalDeviceAccessOnCtrlAltDel](/windows/client-management/mdm/clouddesktop-csp#userenablephysicaldeviceaccessonctrlaltdel) and [Configuration service providers - User/EnablePhysicalDeviceAccessOnErrorScreens](/windows/client-management/mdm/clouddesktop-csp#userenablephysicaldeviceaccessonerrorscreens).

Windows 365 Boot to Cloud supports the physical device access policy on the following versions of Windows and later:

- Windows 11, version 23H2 OS build 22621.4249 or later.

## Prevent access to physical device's Task Manager

In Windows 365 Boot, the local device’s Task Manager can be accessed when users press Ctrl+Alt+Delete. The Task Manager can be disabled by using the [DisableTaskMgr CSP policy](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-ctrlaltdel#disabletaskmgr).

This policy prevents the use of the Task Manager in the system for all users including admins. It also prevents the launch of Task Manager using shortcut keys on the physical device. While this policy increases the security of the device, this lack of access to the physical device makes it harder to troubleshoot issues on the device.

## Prevent users from changing the physical device's password

Changing user passwords isn't supported for Windows 365 Boot physical devices. If this option is used in your environment, it can be disabled to avoid confusing users by using the [DisableChangePassword CSP policy](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-ctrlaltdel#disablechangepassword).

## Set default credential provider

Windows 365 Boot is designed for shared PC mode. This mode requires the username and password authentication method. Depending on your environment, other authentication providers might be configured and could confuse your users. To avoid this confusion, consider setting the default credential provider to username and password. To set this default, use the [DefaultCredentialProvider CSP policy](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-credentialproviders#defaultcredentialprovider).  

## Remove Notifications and Action Center from the task bar

If your devices have touchscreens, it's possible for users to interact with physical device's Notification Center and calendar view. These components also let users launch the Settings app for the Windows 365 Boot physical device. To remove the user's ability to access these components, use the [DisableNotificationCenter CSP policy](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-taskbar#disablenotificationcenter).

## Prevent physical device notifications

Notifications from the Windows 365 Boot physical device can display over the Cloud PC session. To prevent such notifications, use the [NoToastNotification CSP policy](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-wpn#notoastnotification).

## Prevent automatic launch of apps during user sign-in

Some applications on the Windows 365 Boot physical device might be configured to automatically launch during user sign-in. To prevent top this behavior, use the [DisableExplorerRunLegacy_1 CSP policy](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-admx-logon?WT.mc_id=Portal-fx#disableexplorerrunlegacy_1).  

## Improve sign-in on touch screen devices

Touchscreen devices require the touch screen keyboard to show during user sign-in. On Windows 365 boot touch screen devices, you can improve the sign-in experience by using the [EnableTouchKeyboardAutoInvokeInDesktopMode CSP policy](/windows/client-management/mdm/policy-csp-textinput#enabletouchkeyboardautoinvokeindesktopmode).

## Prevent users from accessing physical device drives

When using Windows 365 Boot, a user's physical device disk drive is redirected to the Cloud PC at sign-in time. After that point, Cloud PC users can interact with the physical device.

To prevent such drive redirection for Windows 365 Boot connections, you can include the Cloud PC in an assignment with Group Policy Objects or the Settings Catalog. For more information, see [Manage device Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) redirections for Cloud PCs](/windows-365/enterprise/manage-rdp-device-redirections).
